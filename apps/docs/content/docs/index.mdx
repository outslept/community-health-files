The License Generator is a powerful tool that helps you add appropriate license files to your projects.

## Workflow

The License Generator follows a simple workflow:

1. **Check for existing license** - The tool first checks if your project already has a license file or license field in package.json
2. **Select a license** - If no license is found, you can choose from a list of popular licenses or search for a specific one
3. **Generate license file** - The tool creates a LICENSE file in your project with the appropriate text
4. **Update package.json** - If your project has a package.json file, the license field is updated to match the chosen license

## How It Works

### License Source

The License Generator uses the [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/) as its source of truth for license information. This ensures that:

- All licenses are standardized and recognized by the open source community
- License texts are accurate and up-to-date
- License identifiers follow industry standards

The license text is obtained through one of two methods:

1. **Direct from SPDX** - The tool includes the `spdx-license-list` package which contains the full text of all SPDX-approved licenses
2. **GitHub API fallback** - For any licenses not available in the package, the tool falls back to the GitHub Licenses API

### License Text Processing

When a license is selected, the tool:

1. Retrieves the full license text with placeholders (e.g., `[year]`, `[fullname]`)
2. Adds the license text to a LICENSE file in the root of your project
3. Adds a note recommending that you customize the placeholders with your information

## Command Line Usage

### Basic Usage

To add a license interactively:

```bash
npx community-health-files license add
```

This launches an interactive CLI that:
- Checks if a license already exists
- Presents a list of popular licenses to choose from
- Allows searching for specific licenses
- Generates the license file

### Adding a Specific License

If you already know which license you want to add:

```bash
npx community-health-files license add MIT
```

This will directly add the MIT license to your project.

## License Selection Guide

When choosing a license, consider:

1. **Permissive vs. Copyleft**
   - Permissive licenses (MIT, Apache, BSD) have minimal restrictions
   - Copyleft licenses (GPL, AGPL) require derivative works to use the same license

2. **Patent Grants**
   - Some licenses (Apache 2.0) explicitly include patent grants
   - Others (MIT, BSD) don't address patents directly

3. **Commercial Use**
   - Most open source licenses allow commercial use
   - Some have specific requirements for commercial users

## Popular Licenses

| License | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| MIT | Permissive | Simple and permissive, requires only attribution |
| Apache 2.0 | Permissive | Includes patent grants and contributor terms |
| GPL 3.0 | Copyleft | Requires derivative works to be open source |
| BSD 3-Clause | Permissive | Similar to MIT but with an additional clause |
| MPL 2.0 | Weak Copyleft | File-level copyleft, allows linking with proprietary code |

## Implementation Details

The tool follows these steps internally:

1. Check for existing license files in the project root
2. Check for license field in package.json if present
3. If no license is found, present the selection interface
4. When a license is selected, fetch the license text
5. Write the license text to a LICENSE file in the project root
6. Update package.json license field if applicable
